The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `FirebaseError: Quota exceeded` error even when the project's usage is well below the free tier limits. This often happens due to a subtle issue with data cleanup.  If you are using a client-side function (like onDisconnect) to remove data, and that function fails due to network issues or other interruptions, the data might remain in the database. Over time, this can lead to exceeding your quota.
